# Changelog

## v0.2.0 (July 2026)

45 commits since v0.1.0. No API or format breaks: state written by 0.1.0 restores
unchanged, and every new behaviour below is either on by default with a
documented opt-out or off by default.

**Distribution.** The runtime image is published:
`ghcr.io/orhaugh/clink-runtime` (`:0.2.0`, `:latest`, `:main`, `:sha-<short>`),
built by a new workflow on every release tag. The Helm chart, the k8s operator
and its samples now default to it, so `helm install` works without building an
image first - previously they referenced a tag that existed only on the author's
machine. Prebuilt `pyclink` wheels build again on a release tag
(`macosx_14_0_arm64`, self-contained, vendoring no dylibs); two deliberate
reductions keep the macOS floor low - the wheel has no object-store filesystems
(`s3://`, `gs://`, `abfs://`) and no HTTPS in its HTTP subsystem. Source builds
keep both. A documentation site publishes to
[orhaugh.github.io/clink](https://orhaugh.github.io/clink/).

**Columnar execution reaches both ends of the pipeline.** Columnar JSON decode is
now the DEFAULT for Kafka tables (`columnar_decode='false'` opts out), with an
adaptive damper so systematically unfaithful data pays ~1.6% rather than 2x, and
the keyed shuffle splits columnar batches on the cluster path with zero row
decode. Operators can now also EMIT born-columnar output: an append-only INNER
join and the windowed fire build typed Arrow columns directly instead of a
name-keyed row per emission, enabled by the planner only where a consumer can
ingest columnar. Gated nexmark q12: sustained slope 1.08M -> 1.83M rec/s (+69%),
CPU 113s -> 54s.

**Performance.** Scratch keys and transparent state probes removed the per-record
key-string build from the window, session window and aggregate operators (q12 row
path -31%) and from the equi-join (-30%), and a pre-sorted bulk join-output build
took the join to -54% cumulative. Born-columnar emission adds -11% CPU on a join
under a filter.

**State.** New opt-in ForSt backend (`CLINK_WITH_FORST=ON`): `forst://`,
`changelog+forst://`, `s3+forst://`, `s3sst+forst://` for live remote data files,
with an SST cache, cross-machine restore and a staging sweep. Deferred-read mode
puts hot-path state in the engine.

**Correctness fixes.** An input is now closed only when closed AND drained,
closing an end-of-stream data-loss race, and a worker registration is installed
before it is acked.

**Build and packaging.** `find_package(clink)` works on a real host; prebuilt
pinned-toolchain archives give the bootstrap a fast path; `zstd` exports as an
absolute path; new `CLINK_HTTP_TLS` and `CLINK_ARROW_OBJECT_STORES` knobs (both
default to the previous behaviour) let a portable artifact drop dependencies it
cannot vendor. CI gained a gate for the Go operator module, which nothing had
compiled before.

## v0.1.0 (July 2026)

Initial public release: the engine as described in the README.

Naming, settled for 1.0: the cluster roles are the **coordinator** (control
plane) and **workers** (subtask hosts), `clink_node --role=coordinator|worker`;
the fluent API entry point is `clink::api::Pipeline`; the in-process test
cluster is `clink::test::TestCluster`. Domain vocabulary (watermarks, windows,
checkpoints, savepoints, keyed state, key groups, slots) is unchanged.

In brief:

- Typed operator DAG and fluent API on a local runtime and a distributed
  Coordinator/Worker runtime (TLS/mTLS, HA, HTTP API + dashboard).
- Event time end to end: watermarks, tumbling/sliding/session windows,
  interval joins, CEP.
- Keyed and broadcast state over in-memory, file-backed, RocksDB, and
  changelog backends; rescale, schema evolution, savepoints.
- Exactly-once checkpointing with true 2PC sinks (file, Kafka, Parquet,
  S3, Postgres) and an effectively-once upsert family.
- Arrow-native columnar wire format and columnar operator fast paths.
- SQL frontend: embedded (`clink run`, libclink C ABI, pyclink, Flight
  SQL) or submitted to a cluster.
- Deterministic incident replay: flight recorder, `state-diff`,
  `replay --verify`, frozen regression bundles.
- State as data: snapshots are Arrow IPC; export to Parquet/Iceberg;
  queryable live state.
- Connector suite across messaging, object storage, table formats,
  databases, and HTTP endpoints (see `docs/connectors/`).
- Public testing framework (`clink::test`), Kubernetes Helm chart and
  operator, reproducible benchmark harnesses.
