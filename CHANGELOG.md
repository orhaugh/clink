# Changelog

## v0.1.0 (July 2026)

Initial public release: the engine as described in the README.

Naming, settled for 1.0: the cluster roles are the **coordinator** (control
plane) and **workers** (subtask hosts), `clink_node --role=coordinator|worker`;
the fluent API entry point is `clink::api::Pipeline`; the in-process test
cluster is `clink::test::TestCluster`. Domain vocabulary (watermarks, windows,
checkpoints, savepoints, keyed state, key groups, slots) is unchanged.

In brief:

- Typed operator DAG and fluent API on a local runtime and a distributed
  Coordinator/Worker runtime (TLS/mTLS, HA, HTTP API + dashboard).
- Event time end to end: watermarks, tumbling/sliding/session windows,
  interval joins, CEP.
- Keyed and broadcast state over in-memory, file-backed, RocksDB, and
  changelog backends; rescale, schema evolution, savepoints.
- Exactly-once checkpointing with true 2PC sinks (file, Kafka, Parquet,
  S3, Postgres) and an effectively-once upsert family.
- Arrow-native columnar wire format and columnar operator fast paths.
- SQL frontend: embedded (`clink run`, libclink C ABI, pyclink, Flight
  SQL) or submitted to a cluster.
- Deterministic incident replay: flight recorder, `state-diff`,
  `replay --verify`, frozen regression bundles.
- State as data: snapshots are Arrow IPC; export to Parquet/Iceberg;
  queryable live state.
- Connector suite across messaging, object storage, table formats,
  databases, and HTTP endpoints (see `docs/connectors/`).
- Public testing framework (`clink::test`), Kubernetes Helm chart and
  operator, reproducible benchmark harnesses.
